# Caesar Cipher Project

This is a simple Python project implementing a Caesar cipher for encoding and decoding messages. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- Encode messages
- Decode messages
- Handles shifts correctly by wrapping around the alphabet
- Ignores characters not in the alphabet (e.g., spaces, punctuation)

## Usage

To use the Caesar cipher, run the `caesar_cipher.py` script. You will be prompted to choose whether you want to encode or decode a message, enter the message, and provide the shift number.
